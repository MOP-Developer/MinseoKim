      <h5>오늘의 뮤직: <i>&#9834; Married in Vegas - The Vamps</i> </h5>
      <br>안녕하세요. 프로젝트를 위해 연습할 공간이 필요해서 블로그 형식으로 개설했습니다. <br>
      <h3> Edgar Allan Poe, <i>The Black Cat(1845)</i> </h3>
      <p> From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and, in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.  </p>
